 * This benchmark models a bounded buffer that is used to synchronize between a
 * group of consumers and a group of producers. In the Akka implementation of
 * this benchmark, all producers, consumers and the manager operate fully
 * asynchronously. However, in the LF implementation everything is synchronous.
 * Thus, strictly speaking, the buffer isn't actually needed as we can design
 * the program so that every tick a producer produces data and a consumer
 * consumes it. But, the number of consumers and producers can be selected
 * arbitrarily. Therefore, we still need some logic that takes care of
 * orchestrating the producers according to the rate at which the consumers
 * consume. Also, we could think about using an alternative design, where the
 * consumers don't become available again immediately after consuming (at a
 * later tag). Therefore, this benchmark still implements most of
 * synchronization logic of the original manager in the Akka version.
